## Overview

# AI Voice Assistant
The AI Voice Assistant is a Python-based application that enables users to interact with their computer using natural language voice commands. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, this project aims to provide a seamless and intuitive way to perform various tasks, from retrieving information to controlling system functions.


## Features

Voice Interaction: Communicate with your computer using voice commands for a hands-free experience.
Multi-Functionality: Perform tasks like weather inquiries, web searches, system control, and more, all through voice commands.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive voice responses guide users through interactions and provide helpful information.
Extensible and Customizable: Easily add new features or functionalities to adapt the assistant to your specific needs.

## Getting Started
